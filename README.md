# WIP: Stake token rev 3

Repository contains a new revision of `StakedTokenV3` and `StakedAaveV3`.

It is important to highlight that stkAAVE and stkABPT are slightly different, that's the reason why the code intended to use for each one is:

- For stkAAVE: StakedAaveV3
- For stkABPT: StakedTokenV3

Thew new `StakedTokenV3` includes en enhanced mechanism to facilitate slashing of the underlying by tracking the `exchangeRate` between $stkToken \leftrightarrow Token$.

The slashing itself must be performed by a slashingAdmin which initially will be the governance short executor. The slashing will result in transferring part of the underlying to a specified address and starting the slashing process by setting a `inPostSlashingPeriod` flag.

While being in post slashing period, no other slashing can be performed. While accounts can exit the pool no-one can enter the pool in that period.

The community can then use (parts of) the funds for recovery. Once the recovery is finished potentially remaining funds should be returned to the pool and mutualized by the remaining stakers.

Once the slashing is officially settled, accounts can reenter the pool and a new slashing can occur.

The `StakedAaveV3` extends on top of `StakedTokenV3` , by adding hooks for managing the GHO discounts via a transferHook.
